I have the following Oracle stored procedure that I want to convert into pure Java code using Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA. Please ensure the following:

Replace Oracle-specific cursor logic with Java for or while loops using JPA queries.
Convert all SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT queries into JPA repository methods or @Query annotations.
Ensure proper transaction management using @Transactional.
Provide the complete solution, including:
Entity class
Repository interface
Service class with business logic
Controller class (if applicable)
Here is the Oracle stored procedure:

sql
Copy
Edit
<INSERT YOUR STORED PROCEDURE CODE HERE>
Please include detailed comments in the Java code for each step of the logic translated from the stored procedure. Use proper naming conventions and annotations to ensure the code is clean and easy to understand.
